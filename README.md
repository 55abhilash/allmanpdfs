# allmanpdfs
A pdf file of all manual pages in linux.
I found the terminal based manual pages in linux (ubuntu) not very interesting. So I wrote this script which generates pdf files of all the available man pages and also a large pdf containing all the man pages.
I used two important tools here, one is called ps2pdf, which converts a man page to pdf. Another is pdfunite, which combines pdf files.
I used file names in /etc/bin, /etc, and /usr/bin to generate man pages, as command executables are listed here.
Happy linuxing!
